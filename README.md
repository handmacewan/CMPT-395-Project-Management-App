Group Project: Design a management app for a manager responsible for a small team of fast food employees.
 - App should be standalone, without internet connection, to be installed on Android phone.
    - Only Manager has access
 - Restaurant, operating in a school, requires 2 shifts, mornings and afternoons, for weekdays. 1 full shift for weekends. 
    - Each shift requires a qualified employee (hired student) for either opening or closing depending on shift.


# My Responsibility

I contributed to this project by taking responsibility for the overall design, development, and testing of the scheduling application. My role included planning and coordinating team meetings, organizing the project schedule, and ensuring smooth communication throughout the development process. I also participated in preparing and delivering the final presentation, as well as managing the end‑to‑end delivery of the completed application.
