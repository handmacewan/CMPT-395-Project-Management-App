Group Project: Design a management app for a manager responsible for a small team of fast food employees.
 - App should be standalone, without internet connection, to be installed on Android phone.
    - Only Manager has access
 - Restaurant, operating in a school, requires 2 shifts, mornings and afternoons, for weekdays. 1 full shift for weekends. 
    - Each shift requires a qualified employee (hired student) for either opening or closing depending on shift.
